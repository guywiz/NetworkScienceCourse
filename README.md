# Network Science Course

This course gathers a number of topics addressed in the context of a course at Universit√© de Bordeaux. Topics include basic network analysis and also looks at graph drawing.

It has been running for a number of years, built in collaboration with [Bruno Pinaud](https://github.com/bpinaud).

Course topics will be added periodically.

- Random networks, small world networks, scale free networks
- Network Centralities
- [Clustering and Network Modularity](./Clustering/README.md)
- Network Projection, Filtering and Transformation
- Graph Drawing

The course will also cover an introductory tutorial to the [Tulip Graph Visualization Framework](https://tulip.labri.fr/), as well as its companion [tulip-python library](https://pypi.org/project/tulip-python/).
